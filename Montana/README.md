# MONTANA

a COMPLETELY USELESS discord bot

## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahroush/Montana
```

You will need to setup a bot on your server before continuing, follow the directions [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token). Following this, you should have your bot appearing in your server and you should have the Discord bot token.

Set your token first and then run bot.py
```bash
$ export TOKEN="YOUR BOT TOKEN"
$ python3 bot.py
```
